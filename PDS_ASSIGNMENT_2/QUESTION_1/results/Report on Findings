1. Data Cleaning

Several numeric columns like Mileage, Engine, Power, and New_Price contained text units (e.g., “18.9 kmpl”, “1197 CC”).

These were cleaned by extracting only the numeric part using regex.

Missing values in numerical features were filled with the median, which avoids distortion from outliers.

Missing values in categorical features (Fuel_Type and Transmission) were filled with the mode (most frequent value).

2. Categorical Encoding

The categorical columns Fuel_Type and Transmission were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

This allowed the dataset to be used for further analysis and future modeling.

3. Feature Engineering

A new column, Car_Age, was created using:
Car_Age = 2024 – Year

This helped to understand how vehicle age influences the price of a used car.

4. dplyr-style operations performed

Select: Extracted important columns like Price, Mileage, Engine, and Car_Age for focused analysis.

Filter: Selected cars with Car_Age < 10 years to study newer vehicles.

Rename: Renamed columns such as Price → Used_Car_Price for clarity.

Mutate: Added a new feature Price_per_km using Price / Kilometers_Driven.

Arrange: Sorted the dataset by Price (descending) to see the most expensive cars.

Summarise: Used groupby to compute average price by fuel type.

5. Key Data Insights

Car prices are mostly concentrated at the lower‐to‐mid range, with a long tail of high-priced models.

Mileage has a negative impact on price — cars with higher mileage generally sell for less.

Engine size and Power show a positive relationship with price; larger engines and more powerful cars tend to be costlier.

Fuel Type matters: diesel cars show slightly higher average prices compared to petrol.

Newer cars (lower Car_Age) are priced higher, confirming expected depreciation trends.

6. Visual Findings

The Price Histogram shows that most cars are priced at the lower end of the market.

The Mileage vs Price scatter plot reveals that although there is variation, higher mileage tends to reduce car price.

These visualizations support the numerical findings and provide strong evidence of how mileage, engine specifications, and age affect used car pricing.

7. Overall Summary

After cleaning the dataset and transforming categorical/numerical variables, meaningful relationships became visible.

The analysis clearly shows that Car Age, Mileage, Engine Power, and Fuel Type are the main factors influencing used car price.

The dataset is now well-organized, fully cleaned, and ready for further modeling or interpretation.
