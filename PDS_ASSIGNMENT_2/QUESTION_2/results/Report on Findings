1. Understanding the Dataset

The diabetes dataset contains 768 patients and includes health indicators such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, BMI, Insulin, Age, and Outcome.

There are no major missing values, so the dataset is ready for sampling and bootstrap analysis after minor cleaning.

🔹 A) Findings from Random Sample of 25 (Mean & Max Glucose)
2. Random sampling observations

A sample of 25 patients was selected using a fixed seed to ensure reproducibility.

The mean Glucose level of the sample was close to the population mean, showing that even small samples can give a reasonable estimate of central tendency.

The maximum Glucose value in the sample was also fairly close to the population maximum, though with more variation because extreme values are harder to capture in small samples.

3. Interpretation

The sample represents the population reasonably well for mean values.

Maximum values are more sensitive to sample size, so small samples may not capture extremes accurately.

🔹 B) Findings from 98th Percentile BMI Comparison
4. BMI percentile insights

The 98th percentile of BMI in the sample is close to the population’s 98th percentile, but shows more variation due to the small sample size.

High-percentile statistics (like 98th or 99th) tend to fluctuate more when the sample is small.

5. Interpretation

Even though the sample percentile gives a rough estimate, high percentiles require larger samples for stable estimates.

This reinforces why percentile-based health indicators (obesity limits, risk thresholds) should be calculated from large datasets.

🔹 C) Findings from Bootstrap Analysis (500 Samples, n = 150)
6. Bootstrap mean insights

Running 500 bootstrap samples with 150 patients each showed that the average bootstrap mean of BloodPressure closely matches the population mean.

This indicates bootstrap is a reliable method for estimating the mean.

7. Bootstrap variability insights

The bootstrap standard deviation was also very close to the population standard deviation.

This shows that bootstrap does a good job approximating the spread or variability of BloodPressure.

8. Bootstrap percentile insights

The bootstrap 98th percentile of BloodPressure is close to the population percentile but shows more variation.

High percentiles are always more unstable than means and standard deviations.

9. Interpretation

The bootstrap distribution of means was approximately normal, supporting the Central Limit Theorem.

The small difference between bootstrap and population values shows that bootstrapping is effective for estimating summary statistics when the full population distribution is unknown.
