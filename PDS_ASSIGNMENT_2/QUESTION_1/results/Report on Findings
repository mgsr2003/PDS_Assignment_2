In this assignment, I worked with a used cars dataset to understand how different features affect the market price of a vehicle. 
The raw data contained several issues like text-based numeric fields (e.g., “18.5 kmpl”, “1197 CC”, “74 bhp”) and missing values. 
I cleaned these by extracting only numbers and filling missing values with the median for numerical fields and the mode for categorical fields.

After cleaning, I converted the categorical variables (Fuel Type and Transmission) into one-hot encoded numerical columns and created a new feature called Car Age, which helped me see how the age of a car affects its value.

From the exploratory analysis, several patterns became clear. Car prices mostly cluster at the lower end but have a long tail of expensive models.
Mileage generally showed a negative influence on price — cars driven more tend to sell for less. 
Engine, power, and newer model years showed a positive relationship with price; stronger engines and newer cars were usually more expensive. 
Fuel type also played a role, where diesel cars tended to have slightly higher average prices compared to petrol cars.

Overall, the cleaned dataset and visualizations revealed that the most important factors affecting a used car’s price are its age, engine power, mileage, and fuel type, with age and mileage being the strongest influencers. This analysis helped transform a messy dataset into meaningful insights about how cars depreciate and what features buyers value the most.
